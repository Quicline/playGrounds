/*
 
 To check your knowledge, hereâ€™s a small task for you: create a struct to store
 information about a car, including its model, number of seats, and current
 gear, then add a method to change gears up or down. Have a think about
 variables and access control: what data should be a variable rather than a
 constant, and what data should be exposed publicly? Should the gear-changing
 method validate its input somehow?
